#  Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

##  Overview
This project builds a simple content-based movie recommendation system using movie genres.

It recommends movies similar to a selected movie based on cosine similarity.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Cosine Similarity

---

##  Dataset
Source: MovieLens Dataset

Data includes:
- Movie Title
- Genres
- Movie ID

---

##  Implementation Steps
1. Loaded dataset.
2. Cleaned genre column.
3. Converted genres into numerical format using CountVectorizer.
4. Computed cosine similarity matrix.
5. Built recommendation function to suggest similar movies.

---

##  How It Works
- Converts movie genres into vector format.
- Calculates similarity score between movies.
- Returns top similar movies based on similarity score.

---

##  Learning Outcome
- Basics of recommender systems
- Vectorization techniques
- Cosine similarity concept

---

##  Future Improvements
- Use TF-IDF instead of CountVectorizer
- Add collaborative filtering
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
